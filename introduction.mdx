MagicBlock is a network on top of Solana for building a new type of games and consumer applications that are **open**, **decentralized** and **unstoppable**. MagicBlock accelerates and extends Solana's capabilities while preserving composability.

### Why MagicBlock Engine?

MagicBlock introduces a new primitive to accelerate and scale Solana without state fragmentation. **Ephemeral Rollups are Just-In-Time, SVM-based runtimes that accelerate state transitions for selected Solana Accounts**. Developers can delegate any account from existing Solana smart contracts into the MagicBlock Engine to access faster performances, customizable runtimes and/or dedicated blockspace.


### What can I build with MagicBlock?

MagicBlock Engine facilitates the creation of any game and consumer application that aims to be trustless, decentralized and unstoppable.

- Games that are **persistent** and can't be stopped, because they don't rely on any server or centralized infrastructure (they run entirely on the blockchain)
- Games that are **permissionlessly composable**. Because all the game data and logic is open, everyone can extend your game with new content, new logic, or interoperate across games without limits.
- **Autonomous Worlds** or any application that leverages decentralization to provide an always-on, global and unstoppable experience.
- Low latency and high throughput financial applications like **decentralized exchanges**, **prediction markets**, **NFT marketplaces** and more.
