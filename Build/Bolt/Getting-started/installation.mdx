## Development Wallet

Run `solana-keygen new` to create a keypair at the default location.
Anchor uses this keypair to run your program tests.

## BOLT

BOLT is built on top of Anchor, therefore having a general knowledge of Anchor will give you the necessary tool to build the game logic.

We recommend reading chapters 1-4 of the [Anchor book](https://book.anchor-lang.com/introduction/what_is_anchor.html)
