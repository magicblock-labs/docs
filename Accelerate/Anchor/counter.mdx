![Counter Program](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielePicco/notes/main/counter.png)

This guide will walk you through the process of writing a simple Anchor program that increments a counter. You'll learn how to deploy this program on Solana and interact with it using a React client.

## Quick Access to Source Code

If you prefer to dive straight into the code:
- [Anchor Program Source](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/magicblock-engine-examples/blob/main/anchor-counter/programs/anchor-counter/src/lib.rs)
- [React Client Source](https://github.com/GabrielePicco/ephemeral-counter-ui)

## Writing the Anchor Program

Let's break down the key components of our counter program:

### Core Functionality

The program implements two main instructions:

1. `initialize`: Sets the counter to 0
2. `increment`: Increments the counter by 1

Here's the core structure of our program:

```rust
#[delegate]
#[program]
pub mod anchor_counter {
    use super::*;

    /// Initialize the counter.
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count = 0;
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Increment the counter.
    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }

    // ... Additional instructions will be added here
}
```


Nothing special here, just a simple Anchor program that increments a counter. The only difference is that we're adding the `delegate` macro to inject some useful logic to interact with the delegation program.
### Delegating the Counter PDA

In order to delegate the counter PDA, and make it writable in an Ephemeral Rollup session, we need to add an instruction which
internally calls the `delegate_account` function. `delegate_account` will CPI to the delegation program, which upon validation will gain ownership of the account.
After this step, an ephemeral validator can start processing transactions on the counter PDA and propose state diff trough the delegation program.

```rust
/// Delegate the account to the delegation program
pub fn delegate(ctx: Context<DelegateInput>) -> Result<()> {
    let pda_seeds: &[&[u8]] = &[TEST_PDA_SEED];

    delegate_account(
        &ctx.accounts.payer, // The account that will pay for opening the delegation session. Rent of opened PDAs will be recover on undelegation.
        &ctx.accounts.pda,  // The PDA to delegate
        &ctx.accounts.owner_program, // The owner program of the PDA, in this case the counter program itself
        &ctx.accounts.buffer,
        &ctx.accounts.delegation_record,
        &ctx.accounts.delegation_metadata,
        &ctx.accounts.delegation_program,
        &ctx.accounts.system_program,
        pda_seeds,   // The seeds to make the PDA signer
        0, // 0 means no time limit for the delegation
        3_000, // Update frequency on the base layer in milliseconds
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Committing while the PDA is delegated

The ephemeral runtime allow to commit the state of the PDA while it is delegated. This is done by calling the `commit_accounts` function.

```rust
/// Increment the counter and manually commit the account in the Ephemeral Rollup session.
pub fn increment_and_commit(ctx: Context<IncrementAndCommit>) -> Result<()> {
    let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
    counter.count += 1;
    commit_accounts(
        &ctx.accounts.payer,
        vec![&ctx.accounts.counter.to_account_info()],
        &ctx.accounts.magic_context,
        &ctx.accounts.magic_program,
    )?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Undelegating the PDA

Undelegating the PDA is done by calling the `commit_and_undelegate_accounts` as part of some instruction.
Undelegation commit the latest state and give back the ownership of the PDA to the owner program.

```rust
/// Undelegate the account from the delegation program
pub fn undelegate(ctx: Context<IncrementAndCommit>) -> Result<()> {
    commit_and_undelegate_accounts(
        &ctx.accounts.payer,
        vec![&ctx.accounts.counter.to_account_info()],
        &ctx.accounts.magic_context,
        &ctx.accounts.magic_program,
    )?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Connecting the React Client

The React client is a simple interface that allows you to interact with the Anchor program.
It uses the Anchor bindings to interact with the program and the MagicBlock SDK to interact with the Ephemeral Rollup session.

The UI code for this project can be found in the [ephemeral-counter-ui repository](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/ephemeral-counter-ui).

<Warning>Iframes only work with some wallets (e.g. Backpack). Alternatively, try the deployed demo here: https://main--ephemeral-counter.netlify.app/</Warning>

### Ephemeral Endpoint Configuration

To interact with the Ephemeral Rollup session, you need to configure the appropriate endpoint:

- For devnet, use the following ephemeral endpoint:

  https://devnet.magicblock.app

- For mainnet, please reach out to the MagicBlock team to receive the appropriate endpoint.

Make sure to update your client configuration to use the correct endpoint based on your development or production environment.

<Note>Currently the routing to different endpoints needs to be done on the client. An RPC router which automatically route transaction to the correct endpoint is being developed</Note>
