description: "How to integrate Ephemeral Rollups in your Solana Program"

From an integration perspective, using Ephemeral rollups is similar to writing a multi-threaded program.
Programs can offload work to an Ephemeral Rollup session to process transactions in a low-latency, high-throughput SVM runtime.
The SVM runtime is provisioned just-in-time, and transactions are processed by nodes from the decentralized networks of ephemeral validators.

Ephemeral Rollups can be used with any program which targets the Solana blockchain, and we maintain a library of common integrations for:

- [Native](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/magicblock-engine-examples)
- [Anchor](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/magicblock-engine-examples/tree/main/anchor-counter)
- [Bolt](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/magicblock-engine-examples/tree/main/bolt-counter)

The main entrypoint for using an ephemeral rollup session is to add `delegation` and `undelegation` steps to your program.

- `Delegation`: This is the process of transferring ownership of one or more of your program's `PDAs` to the delegation program.
- `Undelegation`: This is the process of transferring ownership of the `PDAs` back to your program.

Additionally, custom CPI can instruct the ephemeral validators to `commit` and `finalize` a state or `close` a session.
