Unstoppable Games, or fully on-chain games, are games whose state and logic run entirely on a blockchain. Building entirely on-chain offers several advantages.

**Permissionless Composability** - On-chain games lower the barrier for **User-Generated Content (UGC)** and **User-Generated Logic (UGL)**. Creators can easily receive royalties or microtransactions for the content they add to a game. When it comes to game logic, anyone can transparently and permissionlessly extend it and alter some of the game mechanics. This can lead to the emergence of new behaviors that the original developer may not have foreseen. Users become active creators of that worldâ€”they are not only playing the game but actively shaping it.

**Trustless Compute** - Blockchains are trustless computing platforms. They rely on decentralized consensus mechanisms and cryptographic principles to ensure the integrity and accuracy of data and transactions. This trustless nature enhances security and transparency, making it ideal for **stake-based matches, wagers, and prediction markets** while eliminating the risks associated with centralized parties.

**Persistency** - Games don't need a server. The blockchain acts as the "backend," and any application running on it inherits its persistency and censorship-resistance properties. This enables the creation of digital experiences that can run **forever**.

**Crypto-Primitives** - On-chain games are natively integrated into a rich system of **protocols and dapps** that developers can access permissionlessly to enrich the player's experience or enhance distribution. DeFi for in-game economies, identity primitives, global payments, and market-driven governance systems (e.g., [Futarchy](https://docs.themetadao.org/)) are just a few examples of what can be leveraged out of the box.

Ultimately, we believe on-chain games will unlock a new chapter of play, allowing players and game developers to collaborate in creating infinitely extendable and customizable digital experiences.
