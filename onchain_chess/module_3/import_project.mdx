In the third module we'll learn how to set up the chess UI in Unity, convert the IDL to C#, build transactions and listen to state changes from the chain to update the game client. 

You find the open source repository [here](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/sol-chess)

Here are the steps to follow
- Clone the URL of the repository git@github.com:magicblock-labs/sol-chess.git 
- open the terminal and run git clone git@github.com:magicblock-labs/sol-chess.git
- open the unity hub and select the project you have just downloaded


In Assets/scenes you find the board scene with the 3d meshes
