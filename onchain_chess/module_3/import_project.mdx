In the third module we'll learn how to set up the chess UI in Unity, convert the IDL to C#, build transactions and listen to state changes from the chain to update the game client.

You find the open source repository [here](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/sol-chess)

Here are the steps to follow

- Clone the URL of the repository `git@github.com:magicblock-labs/sol-chess.git`
- open the terminal and run `git clone git@github.com:magicblock-labs/sol-chess.git`
  <img class="w-full h-auto max-w-5xl" src="/images/git_clone.png" />
- open the unity hub and select the project you have just downloaded

In Assets/scenes you find the board scene with the 3d meshes
