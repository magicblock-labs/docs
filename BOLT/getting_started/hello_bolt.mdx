To initialize a new project, simply run:

```bash
bolt init <my_project>
```

This creates a new bolt workspace you can move into. The following are some of the important files in the folder:

- The .anchor folder: It includes the most recent program logs and a local ledger that is used for testing
- The app folder: An empty folder that you can use to hold your frontend if you use a monorepo
- The programs folder: This folder contains your programs. It can contain multiple but initially only contains a program with the same name as `<my_project>`. This program already contains a lib.rs file with some sample code.
- The tests folder: The folder that contains your E2E tests. It will already include a file that tests the sample code in the `programs/<my_project>`.
- The migrations folder: In this folder you can save your deploy and migration scripts for your programs.
- The Anchor.toml file: This file configures workspace wide settings for your programs. Initially, it configures
  - The addresses of your programs on localnet ([programs.localnet])
  - A registry your program can be pushed to ([registry])
  - A provider which can be used in your tests ([provider])
  - Scripts that Anchor executes for you ([scripts]). The test script is run when running anchor test. You can run your own scripts with `anchor run <my_script>`.

Run the example unit test with the following command:

```bash
bolt test
```

This command will register a new World instance, create an entity, attach a component, and execute a system on it. The test script is available as a reference under the tests folder.

## Anchor

Bolt is built on top of Anchor and supports all Anchor commands, in addition to some extensions.
For the complete list of Anchor commands, refer to the [Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).
