#### 🔴 Problems with Infrastructure

- **Centralized Control & Single Points of Failure** – Networks, supply chains, and financial systems rely on centralized entities, making them vulnerable to outages, corruption, or censorship.
- **High Costs & Inefficiencies** – Multiple intermediaries slow down operations, increase costs, and introduce human errors.
- **Lack of Transparency & Trust** – Data manipulation and fraud thrive in closed systems, making it hard to verify authenticity.

#### ⛓️ Current Blockchain Limitations

- **Scalability Challenges** – Most blockchains struggle with high transaction loads, limiting their use for real-time infrastructure needs.
- **High Costs** – Rising gas fees make microtransactions and IoT integrations impractical.
- **Latency & Finality Delays** – Many blockchains require multiple confirmations, preventing instant execution in critical applications.
