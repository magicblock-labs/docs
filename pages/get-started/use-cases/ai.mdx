#### 🔴 Problems with AI

- **Centralized Control** – AI models are closed-source and biased.
- **Opaque Decision-Making** – Users cannot verify AI logic or data.
- **Monopoly on AI Access** – Only big tech controls AI resources.

#### ⛓️ Current Blockchain Limitations

- **Computational Cost** – On-chain AI execution is expensive.
- **Data Availability** – Limited high-speed on-chain data for AI.
- **Scalability** – AI models struggle with real-time blockchain inference.
