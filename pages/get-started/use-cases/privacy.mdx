#### 🔴 Problems with Privacy

- **Data Exposure** – Sensitive information is on the public ledger.
- **Centralized Trust** – Users must trust third parties with their private data.
- **Lack of Verifiability** – No way to prove computations were performed correctly without revealing data.

#### ⛓️ Current Blockchain Limitations

- **Public Execution** – All transactions and smart contract state are visible on-chain.
- **MEV Exploitation** – Front-running and sandwich attacks exploit transaction visibility.
- **Compliance Barriers** – Regulatory requirements often conflict with public transparency.

#### ⚡ MagicBlock's Solution

- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** on Intel TDX – Secure, isolated computing environments that protect data during processing.
- **Private State Execution** – Run computations on sensitive data without exposing it to the network.
- **Verifiable Privacy** – Cryptographic proofs ensure correct execution while maintaining confidentiality.
