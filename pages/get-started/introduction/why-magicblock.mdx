  MagicBlock is an extension of the Solana network designed for high-performance
  decentralized applications. It enhances Solana’s capabilities while preserving
  its composability and integrity.

## Why MagicBlock?

Most applications rely on centralized servers for cost efficiency, performance and security. While blockchain technology is revolutionizing decentralized applications, it still faces key challenges:

- **Latency** – Blockchain transaction speeds are too slow for real-time applications.
- **Cost** – Even "low-fee" blockchains can become expensive at scale.
- **Scalability** – Current architectures struggle to handle high-throughput applications.

MagicBlock overcomes these limitations with an ephemeral rollup, seamlessly blending the best of centralized and decentralized infrastructures—without trade-offs.

## What is MagicBlock?

MagicBlock Engine is a **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** based **Ephemeral Rollup (ER)** system that seamlessly integrates with Solana’s base layer. While traditional rollups and Solana’s execution model have constraints for resource-intensive applications, MagicBlock eliminates these limitations by enabling:

- ✅ **Real-Time State Transitions**: Solana’s default 400 ms block time isn’t fast enough for real-time applications. MagicBlock allows **custom execution environments with 10 ms latency** while maintaining full compatibility.
- ✅ **Composability of SVM Ecosystem**: Traditional rollups fragment application states across multiple environments. MagicBlock **syncs programs and states** across Solana’s base layer and ephemeral rollup.
- ✅ **Near-Zero Transaction Fees**: Even a $0.01 fee per transaction adds up at scale. MagicBlock drastically reduces costs, enabling **gasless or near-zero** transactions.
- ✅ **Horizontal Scalability**: Traditional rollups struggle to scale efficiently while preserving decentralization. MagicBlock enables **horizontal auto-scaling** ephemeral rollups, handling millions of transactions per second.
- ✅ **Developer-Friendly Deployment**: Programs deployed on Solana remain fully compatible with MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollup down to the bytecode, making migration effortless.
