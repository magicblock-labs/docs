## Fees

MagicBlock pricing is similar to a decentralized cloud-infrastructure. The protocol is designed to keep computing costs predictable for application developers, while at the same time offering the flexibility to run your own nodes and enforce fees for priority access if desired. There are two types of pricing available for Public nodes or Dedicated nodes.

### Public Nodes

Public nodes enable everyone to start building on MagicBlock with free transactions and without friction. Session fees are charged per ER session and are enforced at undelegation. Commit fees are enforced every time you commit an account to Solana.

| **Fee type**    | **Amount (SOL)** | **Description** |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------- |
| **Base fee**    | 0                | per Tx          |
| **Session fee** | 0.0003           | per ER Session  |
| **Commit fee**  | 0.0001           | per Commit      |

### Dedicated Nodes

Dedicated nodes provide maximum reliability and quality of service for enterprises and teams at scale. Prevent MEV and benefit from predictable costs with your own dedicated nodes.

| **Fee type**    | **Amount (SOL)** | **Description** |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------- |
| **Base fee**    | 0.0000005        | per Tx          |
| **Session fee** | 0.0003           | per ER Session  |
| **Commit fee**  | 0.0001           | per Commit      |
