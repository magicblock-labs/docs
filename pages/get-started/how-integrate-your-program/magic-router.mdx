**Magicblock's Magic Router** is an dynamic transaction routing engine that accelerates transactions by intelligently deciding where they should be executed — either on **Ephemeral Rollups** or **Solana** — based on transaction metadata.

This removes the complexity of infrastructure decisions from the developer’s workflow, enabling seamless user experiences across different execution environments.

### **What Does It Do**

<img class="w-full h-auto max-w-5xl" src="/images/magic-router.png" />

The Magic Router analyzes each transaction’s metadata (e.g. writable accounts, owner, and signer) and automatically routes it to the closest dedicated endpoint:

- **Ephemeral Rollup** for fast, low-latency, zero-cost execution
- **Solana** for persistent, high-throughput execution

This eliminates the need for manual routing logic from the developer, providing significant benefits in transaction speed and development experience.

- ✅ **Simple Integration with Single Endpoint**: Just connect to a single RPC endpoint.
- ✅ **Seamless Wallet Experience**: Connect, sign, and submit — no need to know what’s happening behind the scenes.
- ✅ **Faster Confirmations**: Magic Router routes to the fastest available endpoint.

### **How It Works**

1. **Client - Transaction Submission**  
   The dApp or user sends a transaction to the Magic Router RPC endpoint.

2. **RPC - Metadata Inspection**  
   The Magic Router inspects the transaction metadata and checks the owner of writable accounts.

3. **Validator - Smart Routing and Execution**  
   Based on the metadata, the router determines whether to send it to:

   - **Ephemeral Rollup**
   - **Solana**

   The router sends the transaction to the right execution layer. Users just sign and submit — no extra steps needed.
