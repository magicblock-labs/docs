import Endpoints from '/snippets/endpoints.mdx'

From an integration perspective, using Ephemeral Rollups is similar to writing a multi-threaded program. Programs can offload work to an Ephemeral Rollup session to process transactions in a low-latency, high-throughput SVM runtime. The SVM runtime is provisioned just-in-time, and transactions are processed by nodes from the decentralized networks of ephemeral validators.

Ephemeral Rollups can be used with any program that targets the Solana blockchain. We maintain a library of common integrations for:

## Lifecycle of the Integration

The lifecycle of integrating Ephemeral Rollups in your program is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write your program">
    Write your Solana program as you normally would, using Anchor, native Rust,
    Bolt, C, or even assembly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add delegation and undelegation hooks">
    Accounts that are delegated can be used as writable in an Ephemeral Rollup
    session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your program on Solana">
    Deploy your program directly on Solana.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute transactions">
    Execute transactions on-chain or off-chain using any SDKs that complies with
    the SVM RPC specification (web3.js, Solana Rust SDK, Unity SDK, or others).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add delegation and undelegation hooks

Empower your program with ultra-latency transactions by adding delegation and undelegation hooks. Simply add two functions from the native Rust SDK to your program.

### Delegation

`Delegation` is the process of transferring ownership of one or more of your program's `PDAs` to the delegation program. Ephemeral Validators will then be able to use the `PDAs` to perform transactions in the SVM runtime and commit the state.

In Rust programs, you can use the `ephemeral_rollups_sdk` crate to delegate accounts.

Install it with:

```bash
cargo add ephemeral_rollups_sdk
```

Then use the `delegate_account` function to delegate an account to the delegation program.

```rust Delegation
use ephemeral_rollups_sdk::cpi::delegate_account;

delegate_account(
    &ctx.accounts.payer, // The account that will pay for opening the session
    &ctx.accounts.pda, // The PDA to delegate
    &ctx.accounts.owner_program, // Owner program of the PDA
    ...
    pda_seeds, // Seeds to make the PDA signer
    0, // 0 means no time limit for the delegation
    3_000, // Update frequency on the base layer in milliseconds
)?;
```

<Note>
  Both delegation and undelegation are CPIs that can be integrated in existing
  instructions of your program
</Note>

### Undelegation

`Undelegation` is the process of transferring ownership of the `PDAs` back to your program.
On undelegation, the state is committed and it trigger the finalization process. Once state it validated, the `PDAs` are unlocked and can be used as normal on mainnet

```rust Delegation
use ephemeral_rollups_sdk::ephem::commit_and_undelegate_accounts;

pub fn undelegate(ctx: Context<IncrementAndCommit>) -> Result<()> {
    commit_and_undelegate_accounts(
        &ctx.accounts.payer,
        vec![&ctx.accounts.pda.to_account_info()],
        &ctx.accounts.magic_context,
        &ctx.accounts.magic_program,
    )?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Additionally, custom CPI can instruct the ephemeral validators to `commit` and `finalize` a state or `close` a session.

<Note>
  Note that commit and undelegation accept a list of accounts. These accounts
  are committed atomically to the base layer which allows to maintain state
  consistency of dependent accounts
</Note>

## Frontend

To make it easier to integrate via the frontend, we created the [Magic Router](/pages/get-started/how-integrate-your-program/magic-router). You send  transactions directly to the magic router, and we can determine for you whether it should be routed to the [Ephemeral Rollup](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) or base layer. 

```typescript Frontend
import { sendMagicTransaction } from "magic-router-sdk";

const connection = new Connection("https://devnet-router.magicblock.app", "confirmed");

// Construct a standard Solana transaction
const transaction = await exampleClient.current?.methods
  .exampleMethod(0)
  .accounts({
      user: userPda,
      user: userKeypair.current.publicKey,
  }).transaction() as Transaction;

const noopInstruction = new TransactionInstruction({
      programId: new PublicKey('11111111111111111111111'),
      keys: [],
      data: Buffer.from(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(5))),
  });
transaction.add(noopInstruction);

// Send the transaction
const signature = await sendMagicTransaction(
  routerConnection,
  tx,
  [userKeypair]
)
```
