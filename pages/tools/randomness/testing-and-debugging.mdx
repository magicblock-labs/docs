When building with verifiable randomness, you can emulate the VRF flow locally before deploying to a live [ephemeral rollup](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup). Use `cargo test-sbf --features test-sbf` to run the EphemeralVrf unit and integration tests.

### Local Mocking

- Use the mock VRF signer provided in the `ephemeral_vrf_sdk` to simulate randomness callbacks.
- Inject deterministic seeds to produce predictable outputs for unit tests.
- You can run the oracle service locally with `cargo run --bin vrf-oracle` to mimic `ProvideRandomness`.

### Troubleshooting

- If a callback fails, verify that the requesting program and seed match the values used to generate the proof.
- Check logs for invalid signer errors. This often indicates a mismatched `vrf_program_identity`.

By replicating the callback and proof verification in your tests, you can catch issues early and ensure your game logic handles both success and failure cases.
