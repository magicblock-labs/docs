title: "What is Verifiable Randomness?"
description: "Provably fair randomness for on-chain logic"
---

Verifiable randomness provides a tamper-proof source of chance for on-chain programs.
Unlike pseudorandom values derived from timestamps or block hashes, it is generated off-chain and delivered alongside a cryptographic proof that anyone can verify on-chain.

MagicBlock rollups access this randomness through the `ephemeral_vrf_sdk`,
which runs entirely within the [ephemeral rollup](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup)
execution window.

This lets programs implement mechanics like loot drops, gacha pulls, or matchmaking without trusting a single party. The receipt proves that the number was produced fairly and cannot be manipulated.

#### Example use cases

- Provably fair loot boxes or chest drops
- Secure gacha systems
- Randomized spawn or resource generation
- Chain-verified PvP matchmaking
- Trustless raffles or giveaways
