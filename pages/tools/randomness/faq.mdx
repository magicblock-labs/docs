### Why not use block hashes for randomness?

Block hashes can be predicted or manipulated by miners and validators, making them unsuitable for fair gameplay. MagicBlock's VRF proves the randomness was generated independently of block production.

### How fast is the randomness callback?

The VRF operates within the [ephemeral rollup](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) execution window, so results are typically available within a single transaction round, without external polling.

### Can I audit the randomness proofs?

Yes. Each request includes a proof that anyone can verify on-chain using the same cryptography as the VRF signer. This transparency ensures players can confirm fairness.
