description: "How MagicBlock integrates verifiable randomness"
---

See the [Ephemeral Rollup documentation](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) for an overview of the runtime.

MagicBlock exposes randomness as a first-class primitive through the `ephemeral_vrf_sdk`. Rollup programs call `create_request_randomness_ix` (the `RequestRandomness` instruction) with a `caller_seed` and a callback such as `consume_randomness`. An oracle from the EphemeralVrf network then executes the `ProvideRandomness` instruction to deliver the result.

Random numbers are generated via a VRF built on Curve25519's Ristretto group and proven using a Schnorr-like signature as described in RFC&nbsp;9381. The proof and output are returned to the rollup with a signed callback from the MagicBlock VRF signer PDA. Your program verifies the caller and then uses the randomness in gameplay logic.

Helper utilities like `random_u32`, `random_u8_with_range`, and `random_bool` make it simple to convert the `[u8; 32]` output into usable values. Because the request and consume steps occur inside the ephemeral execution window, users get real-time results with verifiable fairness and without relying on external servers.

## Flow

<img class="w-full h-auto max-w-5xl" src="/images/vrf-flow.png" />

The flow starts with a “Request for randomness”.

1. Your program will CPI into the MagicBlock VRF program and append a request to the queue.
2. Once your randomness request is in the queue, an oracle will release the request and perform the randomness computation.
3. Upon completion, it returns the result and proof to the MagicBlock VRF program.
4. After verifying the proof, the VRF program will call back into your program into a predefined function that will “consume” the randomness.

<Note>
  The EphemeralVrf codebase is still under active development and has not been
  audited. Test thoroughly before integrating it into production rollups.
