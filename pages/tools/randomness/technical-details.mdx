See the [Ephemeral Rollup documentation](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) for an overview of the runtime.

MagicBlock exposes randomness as a first-class primitive through the `ephemeral_vrf_sdk`. Rollup programs call `create_request_randomness_ix`, providing a `caller_seed` and a callback, such as `consume_randomness`.

Random numbers are generated via a VRF built on Curve25519 and proven using Schnorr-style signatures. The proof and output are returned to the rollup with a signed callback from the MagicBlock VRF signer PDA. Your program verifies the caller and then uses the randomness in gameplay logic.

Helper utilities like `random_u32`, `random_u8_with_range`, and `random_bool` make it simple to convert the `[u8; 32]` output into usable values. Because the request and consume steps occur inside the ephemeral execution window, users get real-time results with verifiable fairness and without relying on external servers.
