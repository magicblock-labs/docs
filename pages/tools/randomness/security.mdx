description: "How randomness proofs are verified"

The randomness proof is cryptographically bound to the input `caller_seed` and to MagicBlock's VRF signer identity. Your callback enforces this with:

```rust
#[account(address = ephemeral_vrf_sdk::consts::VRF_PROGRAM_IDENTITY)]
pub vrf_program_identity: Signer<'info>,
```

Only the official MagicBlock oracle can trigger the callback, preventing spoofed or manipulated results. Invalid proofs automatically fail, and other programs cannot front‑run the request.

Avoid letting users provide the entire `caller_seed` directly—combine it with game state or timestamps to prevent seed grinding. Because everything executes inside the deterministic rollup, the random value cannot be reused or delayed.
This enforcement happens within the same [ephemeral rollup](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) that executes your game logic.
