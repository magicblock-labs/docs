Now that you have set up the hooks and provider, let's look at some examples of using the provided methods.

### Creating a Session

To create a session, call the `createSession` method from the `sessionWallet`. This method accepts three parameters:

1. `targetProgramPublicKey`: A `PublicKey` instance representing the target program you want to interact with.
2. `topUp`: A boolean value, set to `true` if you want to top up an session keypair with `0.01 SOL` initially and \`false\` if you dont want to topUp the session Keypair.
3. `expiryInMinutes`: An optional parameter, representing the session's expiry time in minutes. The default value is 60 minutes.

```typescript
const handleCreateSession = async () => {
  const targetProgramPublicKey = new PublicKey(
    "your_target_program_public_key"
  );
  const topUp = true;
  const expiryInMinutes = 60;

  const session = await sessionWallet.createSession(
    targetProgramPublicKey,
    topUp,
    expiryInMinutes
  );

  // you can also specify the amount you want to topUp the session wallet.
  //This will top up the amount specified, and when revoked, send back to the authority
  const session = await sessionWallet.createSession(
    targetProgramPublicKey,
    topUp ? 10000000 : 0, // 0.01 SOL
    expiryInMinutes
  );

  if (session) {
    console.log("Session created:", session);
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to create session");
  }
};
```

By calling `createSession`, a new ephemeral keypair is generated and stored on the client-side. The session token is then created and stored alongside the keypair. This enables the user to securely sign transactions using the generated keypair without revealing their actual wallet's private key.

### Signing and Sending a Transaction

To sign and send a transaction, use the `signAndSendTransaction` method. This method first signs the transaction using the ephemeral key pair created during the session. Then, it sends the signed transaction to the Solana network.

```typescript
const handleSendTransaction = async () => {
  const transaction = new Transaction();
  // Add instructions to the transaction
  const txids = await sessionWallet.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);

  if (txids && txids.length > 0) {
    console.log("Transaction sent:", txids);
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to send transaction");
  }
};
```

The `signAndSendTransaction` method provides an extra layer of security by ensuring that the actual wallet's private key is not exposed. The ephemeral key pair stored on the client-side is used to sign the transaction, thus keeping the user's main wallet secure.

### Revoking a Session

To revoke a session, call the `revokeSession` method from the `sessionWallet`. This method performs three actions:

1. It removes the ephemeral key pair and the session token from the client-side storage.
2. It revokes the session from the contract.
3. Returns the lamports to the authority and closes the session token pda

```typescript
const handleRevokeSession = async () => {
  await sessionWallet.revokeSession();
  console.log("Session revoked");
};
```

Revoking a session ensures that the ephemeral key pair is no longer valid and usable.

These examples should help you get started with implementing session management and wallet functionality in your app.
