Session Keys are a part of the Gum React-SDK, so you need to install the package using either yarn or npm:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Yarn
yarn add @magicblock-labs/gum-react-sdk
```

```bash Npm
npm i @magicblock-labs/gum-react-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

With the package installed, you can now begin integrating the session wallet management system into your dApp for enhanced security and user experience.
