description: "What are Session Keys?"
---

Session Keys are meant to be used as secondary signers in your program, especially for frequent interactions like liking a post or moving a piece in a game of chess where constant popups can get in the way of smooth user experience. **They are not burner wallets**.&#x20;

Session Keys work in tandem with our on chain program to validate the token and it's scope.

## **Session Keys have two components**

1. An **Ephemeral Keypair**, intended to be used as a **secondary signer** in the target program.
2. A **Session Token**, a PDA containing information about **expiry and scope** of the keypair.

## **How do they work?**

- Ephemeral Keys are stored on the client side, to invoke transactions.
- The transactions invoked by these ephemeral keys are validated in the target program for their validity, expiry and scope.
- Every transaction needs to present both the ephemeral signer and the session token
- This is the general idea behind _account abstraction_, where instead of just an externally owned key there is also smart contract that enhances security.
