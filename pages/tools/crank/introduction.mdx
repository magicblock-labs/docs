## What Are Cranks?

Cranks (scheduled tasks) enable **automated, time-based execution** of on-chain instructions without requiring manual user intervention. In traditional blockchain systems, every action requires a user to sign and submit a transaction, which limits automation capabilities.

With MagicBlock's Ephemeral Rollups, you can schedule tasks that execute automatically at predetermined intervals, bringing powerful automation capabilities to your Solana programs.

## Key Benefits

- **Automated Execution**: Programs can execute instructions at predetermined intervals without user interaction
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for off-chain cron jobs or monitoring services
- **Decentralization**: Execution happens on-chain, maintaining trustless guarantees
- **Reliability**: Scheduled tasks execute reliably within the blockchain's consensus mechanism

## Use Cases

- **Periodic State Updates**: Update prices, clear expired data, or refresh game state
- **Automated Workflows**: Recurring payments, vesting schedules, or subscription renewals
- **Game Mechanics**: Periodic rewards, time-based events, or automated game progression
- **DeFi Operations**: Rebalancing portfolios, liquidation checks, or yield compounding

## How It Works

Cranks leverage MagicBlock's Ephemeral Rollups to provide scheduled execution:

1. **Initialize** your program state on Solana base layer
2. **Delegate** accounts to Ephemeral Rollup for faster execution
3. **Schedule** a crank task that automatically executes instructions
4. **Execute** automatically at specified intervals
5. **Undelegate** accounts back to Solana base layer when done

The scheduling happens through Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) to MagicBlock's scheduling program, which handles the actual execution timing and reliability.
