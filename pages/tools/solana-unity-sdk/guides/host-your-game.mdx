Solana.Unity SDK is fully compatible with WebGL. In this tutorial you will compile the Solana.Unity-SDK [demo scene](https://garbles-labs.github.io/Solana.Unity-SDK/) and publish it using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

With GitHub pages, GitHub allows you to host a webpage from your repository.

## Compile the game to WebGL

1. Download and Install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
2. Install the Solana.Unity-SDK following the [instructions](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK#installation) and import the example
3. Compile the scene to WebGL (be sure to [disable compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jjESP58jsA), as GH pages does not support serving compressed files)

  If you want to skip the compilation step, you can fork the SDK repository,
  which contained a pre-compiled WebGL build in the
  [gp-pages](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/tree/gh-pages)
  branch
</Card>

## Host the demo on Github pages

- Create a new repository
- Navigate to the build folder containing the index.html

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "WebGL game"
git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>
git push origin <branch>
```

- You repository should now looks similar to the SDK [gp-pages](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/tree/gh-pages) branch.
- Enable gh-pages deployment from the repository settings

Github will provide a url for the live deployment: [garbles-labs.github.io/Solana.Unity-SDK](https://garbles-labs.github.io/Solana.Unity-SDK/)
