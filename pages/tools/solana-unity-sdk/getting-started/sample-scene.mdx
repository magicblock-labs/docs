## Features

- Prefabs are templates that store Objects configuration. They can be used to create instances of the same assets and are easily reusable
- Scenes folder contains the full demo deployed here.
- Scrips folder contains different scripts examples (I.e. Assets/Samples/Solana SDK/0.1.1/Sample Wallet/Solana Wallet/Scripts/example/screens/SwapScreen.cs for Orca Swaps)
- Animations, Materials, Plugins and Textures are self-explanatory

Play around with the demo scene to familiarize yourself with the basic functionality of Wallets, NFT loading, transfers, swaps etc.
