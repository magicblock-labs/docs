Learn how to configure your preferred wallet

The SDK supports a veriety of wallets, including

| Wallet                   | Support | Type     |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| In-game (new or restore) | ‚úÖ      | In-app   |
| In-game (Web3auth)       | ‚úÖ      | In-app   |
| Wallet Adapter           | ‚úÖ      | External |
| Mobile Wallet Adapter    | ‚úÖ      | External |
| Seed Vault               | üèó       | In-app   |

## Interface

`IWalletBase` defines the common [interface](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/blob/main/Runtime/codebase/IWalletBase.cs)

The WalletBase abstract class implements `IWalletBase` interface and provides convenient methods shared by all wallet adapters.

A few examples are:

- Connection to Mainnet/Devnet/Testnet or custom RPC
- Login/logout
- Account creation
- Get balance
- Get token accounts
- Sign/partially sign transactions
- Send transactions

## Login example

You can attach the [Web3.cs](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/blob/main/Runtime/codebase/Web3.cs) script
(../Runtime/Codebase/Web3.cs) to any game object on the scene, then call Web3.Instance.LoginWalletAdapter();

## Wallet Adapter

To configure a wallet following the [Wallet Adapter](https://solana-mobile.github.io/mobile-wallet-adapter/spec/spec.html) standard use the [SolanaWalletAdapterWebGL](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/blob/main/Runtime/codebase/SolanaWalletAdapterWebGL.cs) wallet implementation.

```csharp
WalletBase wallet = new SolanaWalletAdapterWebGL(walletAdapterOptions, RpcCluster.DevNet, ...);
```

## SMS

Solana Mobile Stack is a set of libraries for wallets and apps, allowing developers to create rich mobile experiences for the Solana network.
For more information about SMS check out the official [documentation](https://solanamobile.com/developers).

## Mobile Wallet Adapter

To configure a wallet following the Mobile Wallet Adapter standard use the [SolanaMobileWalletAdapter](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/blob/main/Runtime/codebase/SolanaMobileWalletAdapter.cs) wallet implementation.

```csharp
WalletBase wallet = new SolanaMobileWalletAdapter(solanaMobileWalletOptions, RpcCluster.DevNet, ...);
```

## Configuring Deeplinks

Some of the wallet, e.g. Phantom, are currently implemented using DeepLinks. Deep links are URLs that link to a specific piece of content or functionality within an app, in the context of Solana transactions, deep links can be used to sign a transaction by allowing users to approve a transaction using their Solana wallet.

### Enabling deep linking for Android applications

To enable deep linking for Android applications, use an [intent filter](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters). An intent filter overrides the standard Android App [Manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html) to include a specific intent filter section for [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity).

To set up the wallet intent filter:

1. In the Project window, go to Assets > Plugins > Android.
2. Create a new file and call it AndroidManifest.xml. Unity automatically processes this file when you build your application.
3. Copy the [code sample](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK/blob/main/Samples~/Solana%20Wallet/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml) into the new file and save it.

_android:scheme="unitydl" should match the value defined in the wallet configuration_

See the detailed explanation on the Unity [documentation page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/deep-linking-android.html).

### Enabling deep linking for IOS applications

See the detailed explanation on the Unity [documentation page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/deep-linking-android.html) .

_the defined schema should match the value defined in the wallet configuration_
