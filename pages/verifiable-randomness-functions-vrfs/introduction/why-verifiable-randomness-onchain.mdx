title: "Why Verifiable Onchain Randomness?"
description: "Verifiable randomness ensures that random outcomes in decentralized applications are **fair, transparent, and tamper-proof**"

**Traditional offchain randomness** suffers from:

- **Lack of transparency** – Users cannot verify how random numbers are generated.
- **Manipulation risks** – Developers, miners, or validators could influence outcomes for financial gain.
- **Delayed or unreliable delivery** – offchain randomness may not align with onchain execution timing.

**Verifiable onchain randomness** solves these challenges by providing:

- ✅ **Cryptographic verification** – Randomness results are proven and validated onchain.
- ✅ **Fairness and trustlessness** – No single party can manipulate outcomes.
- ✅ **Full transparency** – Every random value can be audited directly on the blockchain.
- ✅ **Instant availability** – Randomness is delivered onchain within seconds, ready for use in smart contracts.
