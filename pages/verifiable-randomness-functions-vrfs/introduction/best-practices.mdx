Use these tips to get the most reliable results when requesting randomness.
Ensure your rollup delegates to a trusted oracle queue with the `DelegateOracleQueue` instruction so that requests are fulfilled promptly.

### Seed Selection

- Combine user input with server timestamps or game state to create unpredictable seeds.
- Avoid letting players specify the entire `caller_seed` to prevent grinding.

### Callback Validation

- Always check the `vrf_program_identity` to confirm the callback is from MagicBlock's official signer.
- Reject callbacks that do not match the original request parameters.

### State Management

- Store any pending request identifiers so that retries or unexpected callbacks can be handled safely.
- Track the oracle queue your requests were delegated to so results can be matched back correctly.
- Keep random outputs ephemeralâ€”consume them immediately within your [rollup logic](/pages/get-started/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) and avoid reusing them.

Following these guidelines reduces the risk of manipulation and ensures consistent randomness across sessions.
