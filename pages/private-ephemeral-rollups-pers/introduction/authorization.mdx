### Authorization Model

<img class="w-full h-auto max-w-5xl" src="/images/TEE_permission.png" />

Private Ephemeral Rollups use a Permission Program to manage fine-grained privacy controls for accounts and account groups. This runs on Solana L1 and can be updated on the fly.

- **Permission Groups**: Define groups with arbitrary membership and IDs via CPI. A group aggregates users and the accounts governed by its permissions.
- **Permissions**: Add permissions to groups. Today a permission implies read access for the delegated account; read/write splits may be added in the future.
- **Access**: Client access to permissioned ER state requires authenticating ownership of a specified public key. Successful authentication yields a token used to query the ER.

<PerEndpoint />

This abstraction into groups lets you modify the permissions for many users/accounts atomically in a single transaction.
