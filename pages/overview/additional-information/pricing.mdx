## Ephemeral Rollup (ER) Nodes

**Public nodes** make it simple to start building on MagicBlock with free transactions and zero friction. Fees are only charged when you close a session or commit data back to Solana.

| **Fee type**    | **Amount (SOL)** | **Description**                  |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Base fee**    | 0                | Per transaction (Tx)             |
| **Session fee** | 0.0003           | Per ER session (at undelegation) |
| **Commit fee**  | 0.0001           | Per commit to Solana             |

**Dedicated nodes** are ideal for enterprises and high-scale teams. They provide maximum reliability, predictable costs, and MEV protection with your own dedicated infrastructure.

| **Fee type**    | **Amount (SOL)** | **Description**      |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------- |
| **Base fee**    | 0.0000005        | Per transaction (Tx) |
| **Session fee** | 0.0003           | Per ER session       |
| **Commit fee**  | 0.0001           | Per commit to Solana |

## Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF)

The VRF service provides **provably fair randomness on-chain**. Fees cover proof generation + posting on-chain.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Costs do not include the transaction fee to request randomness.

| **Fee type**                    | **Amount (SOL)** | **Description**        |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Base fee (within 1‚Äì2 slots)** | 0.0005           | Per randomness request |
