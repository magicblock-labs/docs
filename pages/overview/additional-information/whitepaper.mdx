**Authors:** Gabriele Picco, Andrea Fortugno

We propose a framework that leverages the **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** to scale fully on-chain applications without state fragmentation or compromised trust assumptions.

To enhance scalability and resource optimization, we introduce the concept of **Ephemeral Rollups (ERs)**:

- Dedicated runtimes customizable for higher operational speed.
- Configurable ticking mechanisms.
- Provable sessions and gasless transactions.
- Achieves scalability without compromising composability.
