## Step-By-Step Guide

Build your program and upgrade it with delegation hooks with MagicBlock's Delegation Program `DELeGGvXpWV2fqJUhqcF5ZSYMS4JTLjteaAMARRSaeSh`:

<Steps>
  <Step title={<a href="#1-write-program">Write your program</a>}>
    Write your Solana program as you normally would.
  </Step>
  <Step
    title={
      <a href="#2-delegate">
        Add delegation and undelegation hooks in your program
      </a>
    }
  >
    Add CPI hooks to delegate, commit and undelegate state accounts through
    Ephemeral Rollup sessions.
    <Validators />
  </Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#3-deploy">Deploy your program on Solana.</a>}>
    Deploy your program directly on Solana using Anchor or Solana CLI.
  </Step>
  <Step
    title={
      <a href="#4-test">
        Ready to execute transactions for delegation and real-time speed
      </a>
    }
  >
    Send transactions without modifications on-chain and off-chain that also
    comply with the SVM RPC specification.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Code Snippets

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Write program">

    The program implements two main instructions:

    1. `initialize`: Sets the counter to 0
    2. `increment`: Increments the counter by 1

    The program implements specific instructions for delegating and undelegating the counter:

    1. `Delegate`: Delegates counter from Base Layer to ER (called on Base Layer)
    2. `CommitAndUndelegate`: Schedules sync of counter from ER to Base Layer, and undelegates counter on ER (called on ER)
    3. `Commit`: Schedules sync of counter from ER to Base Layer (called on ER)
    4. `Undelegate`:
        - Schedules sync and undelegation of counter (called on ER)
        - Undelegation triggered through callback instruction injected through #[ephemeral] (called on Base Layer through validator CPI)
    <WriteProgramCode />

    Nothing special here, just a simple Anchor program that increments a counter. The only difference is that we're adding the `ephemeral` macro for undelegation and `delegate` macro to inject some useful logic to interact with the delegation program.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="2. Delegate">
      <Validators />
    1. Add `ephemeral-rollups-sdk` with Anchor features to your program

    ```bash
    cargo add ephemeral-rollups-sdk --features anchor
    ```

    Import `delegate`, `commit`, `ephemeral`, `DelegateConfig`, `commit_accounts` and `commit_and_undelegate_accounts`:

    ```rust
    use ephemeral_rollups_sdk::anchor::{
      commit,
      delegate,
      ephemeral
    };
    use ephemeral_rollups_sdk::cpi::DelegateConfig;
    use ephemeral_rollups_sdk::ephem::{
      commit_accounts,
      commit_and_undelegate_accounts
      };
    ```

    2.  Add `delegate` macro and instruction, `ephemeral` macro, and `undelegate` instruction to your program. Specify your preferred delegation config such as auto commits and specific ER validator:
    <DelegateCode />
    <CommitCode />
    <UndelegateCode />

    <DelegationInfo />

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="3. Deploy">
    Now you’re program is upgraded and ready! Build and deploy to the desired
    cluster:

    ```bash
    anchor build && anchor deploy
    ```

    [⬆️ Back to Top](#code-snippets)

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="4. Test">
    Ready to execute transactions for delegation and real-time speed.
    <Validators />

    ```bash
    anchor test --skip-build --skip-deploy --skip-local-validator
    ```
    Run the following test:
    <TestCode />

    To make it easier to integrate via the frontend, we created the [Magic Router](/pages/ephemeral-rollups-ers/introduction/magic-router). You send transactions directly to the magic router, and we can determine for you whether it should be routed to the [Ephemeral Rollup](/pages/ephemeral-rollups-ers/introduction/ephemeral-rollup) or base layer.

### Advanced Code Snippets

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Resize PDA">
    When resizing a delegated PDA:
    - PDA must have enough lamports to remain rent-exempt for the new account size.
    - If additional lamports are needed, the **payer account must be delegated** to provide the difference.
    - PDA must be owned by the program, and the transaction must include any signer(s) required for transferring lamports.
    - Use `system_instruction::allocate`
