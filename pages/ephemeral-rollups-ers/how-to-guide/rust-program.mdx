## Step-By-Step Guide

Build your program and upgrade it with delegation hooks with MagicBlock’s Delegation Program `DELeGGvXpWV2fqJUhqcF5ZSYMS4JTLjteaAMARRSaeSh`:

<Steps>
  <Step
    title={
      <a href="#1-write-program">
        Write program and add delegation instructions
      </a>
    }
  >
    Write your Solana program as you normally would.
  </Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#2-delegate">Delegate PDA on Base Layer</a>}>
    Add CPI hooks to delegate, commit and undelegate state accounts through
    Ephemeral Rollup sessions.
    <Validators />
  </Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#3-commit">Commit PDA on ER</a>}>
    Deploy your program directly on Solana using Solana CLI.
  </Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#4-undelegate">Undelegate PDA on ER</a>}>
    Send transactions without modifications on-chain and off-chain that also
    comply with the SVM RPC specification.

## Counter Example

<SoftwareRust />

### Code Snippets

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Write Program">

    The program implements two main instructions:

    1. `InitializeCounter`: Initialize and sets the counter to 0 (called on Base Layer)
    2. `IncreaseCounter`: Increments the initialized counter by X amount (called on Base Layer or ER)

    The program implements specific instructions for delegating and undelegating the counter:

    1. `Delegate`: Delegates counter from Base Layer to ER (called on Base Layer)
    2. `CommitAndUndelegate`: Schedules sync of counter from ER to Base Layer, and undelegates counter on ER (called on ER)
    3. `Commit`: Schedules sync of counter from ER to Base Layer (called on ER)
    4. `Undelegate`: Undelegates counter on the Base Layer (called on Base Layer through validator CPI)

    Here's the core structure of our program:

    {" "}
    <InstructionsCode />
    <Note>
      Your "Undelegate" instruction must have the exact discriminator. It is never
      called by you, instead the validator on the Base Layer will callback with a
      CPI into your program after undelegating your account on ER.
    </Note>

  <Tab title="2. Delegate">
    ### Delegating the Counter PDA

    In order to delegate the counter PDA, and make it writable in an Ephemeral Rollup session, we need to add an instruction which
    internally calls the `delegate_account` function. `delegate_account` will CPI to the delegation program, which upon validation will gain ownership of the account.
    After this step, an ephemeral validator can start processing transactions on the counter PDA and propose state diff trough the delegation program.

    <Tab title="3. Commit">
    ### Committing while the PDA is delegated

    The ephemeral runtime allow to commit the state of the PDA while it is delegated. This is done by calling the `commit_accounts` function.

  <Tab title="4. Undelegate">
    ### Undelegating the PDA

    Undelegating the PDA is done by calling the `commit_and_undelegate_accounts` as part of some instruction.
    Undelegation commit the latest state and give back the ownership of the PDA to the owner program. After undelegating and finalizing the state, the validator will create a callback CPI into "undelegate" on the Base Layer.

### Advanced Code Snippets

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Resize PDA">
    When resizing a delegated PDA:
    - PDA must have enough lamports to remain rent-exempt for the new account size.
    - If additional lamports are needed, the **payer account must be delegated** to provide the difference.
    - PDA must be owned by the program, and the transaction must include any signer(s) required for transferring lamports.
    - Use `system_instruction::allocate`
