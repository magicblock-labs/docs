This guide will walk you through the process of writing a simple Anchor program that increments a counter. You'll learn how to deploy this program on Solana and interact with it using a React client.

## Writing the Anchor Program

<Steps>
  <Step
    title={
      <a href="#overview">Write program and add delegation instructions</a>
    }
  ></Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#delegate">Delegate PDA on Base Layer</a>}></Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#commit">Commit PDA on ER</a>}></Step>
  <Step title={<a href="#undelegate">Undelegate PDA on ER</a>}></Step>
</Steps>

Let's break down the key components of our counter program:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    ## Core Functionality

    The program implements two main instructions:

    1. `initialize`: Sets the counter to 0
    2. `increment`: Increments the counter by 1

    The program implements specific instructions for delegating and undelegating the counter:

    1. `Delegate`: Delegates counter from Base Layer to ER (called on Base Layer)
    2. `CommitAndUndelegate`: Schedules sync of counter from ER to Base Layer, and undelegates counter on ER (called on ER)
    3. `Commit`: Schedules sync of counter from ER to Base Layer (called on ER)
    4. `Undelegate`: Undelegates counter on the Base Layer (called on Base Layer through validator CPI)

    <WriteProgramCode />

    Nothing special here, just a simple Anchor program that increments a counter. The only difference is that we're adding the `ephemeral` macro for undelegation and `delegate` macro to inject some useful logic to interact with the delegation program.

  <Tab title="Delegate">
    ### Delegating the Counter PDA

    In order to delegate the counter PDA, and make it writable in an Ephemeral Rollup session, we need to add an instruction which
    internally calls the `delegate_account` function. `delegate_account` will CPI to the delegation program, which upon validation will gain ownership of the account.
    After this step, an ephemeral validator can start processing transactions on the counter PDA and propose state diff trough the delegation program.

  <Tab title="Commit">
    ### Committing while the PDA is delegated

    The ephemeral runtime allow to commit the state of the PDA while it is delegated. This is done by calling the `commit_accounts` function.

  <Tab title="Undelegate">
    ### Undelegating the PDA

    Undelegating the PDA is done by calling the `commit_and_undelegate_accounts` as part of some instruction.
    Undelegation commit the latest state and give back the ownership of the PDA to the owner program.

## Connecting the React Client

The React client is a simple interface that allows you to interact with the Anchor program.
It uses the Anchor bindings to interact with the program and the MagicBlock SDK to interact with the Ephemeral Rollup session.
