## Dynamic Transaction Routing

**Magicblock's Magic Router** is an dynamic transaction routing engine that accelerates transactions by intelligently deciding where they should be executed — either on **Ephemeral Rollups** or **Solana** — based on transaction metadata.

This eliminates the need for manual routing logic from the developer, providing significant benefits in transaction speed and development experience.

- ✅ **Simple Integration with Single Endpoint**: Just connect to a single RPC endpoint.
- ✅ **Seamless Wallet Experience**: Connect, sign, and submit — no need to know what’s happening behind the scenes.
- ✅ **Faster Confirmations**: Magic Router routes to the fastest available endpoint.

## Code Snippets

Initialize connection with Magic Router before you send transaction dynamically.

<Routers />

Utilize MagicBlock's SDK to initialize, send and confirm transaction:

- `ephemeral-rollups-kit` powered with `@solana/kit`
- `ephemeral-rollups-sdk` powered with `@solana/web.js`

<CodeGroup>
```ts kit
import { 
  Connection, 
} from "@magicblock-labs/ephemeral-rollups-kit";

// Initialize connection
const connection = await Connection.create(
"https://devnet-router.magicblock.app",
"wss://devnet-router.magicblock.app"
)

// ... create transaction

// Send and confirm transaction
const txHash = await connection.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
transactionMessage,
[userKeypair],
{ commitment: "confirmed", skipPreflight: true }
)

````

```ts web3.js
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { ConnectionMagicRouter } from "@magicblock-labs/ephemeral-rollups-sdk";

// Initialize connection
const connection = new ConnectionMagicRouter(
  "https://devnet-router.magicblock.app/",
  { wsEndpoint: "wss://devnet-router.magicblock.app/" }
);

// ... create transaction

// Send and confirm transaction
const txHash = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [payer], {
  skipPreflight: true,
  commitment: "confirmed",
});
````

</CodeGroup>

The Magic Router analyzes each transaction’s metadata (e.g. writable accounts, owner, and signer) and automatically routes it to the closest dedicated endpoint:

<img class="w-full h-auto max-w-5xl" src="/images/magic-router-scenarios.png" />
1. **Client - Transaction Submission** The dApp or user sends a transaction to the
Magic Router RPC endpoint.

2. **RPC - Metadata Inspection**
   The Magic Router inspects the transaction metadata and checks the owner of writable accounts.

3. **Validator - Smart Routing and Execution**
   Based on the metadata, the router determines whether to send it to:

   - **Ephemeral Rollup** for fast, low-latency, zero-cost execution
   - **Solana** for persistent, high-throughput execution
