## Dynamic Transaction Routing

**Magicblock's Magic Router** is an dynamic transaction routing engine that accelerates transactions by intelligently deciding where they should be executed — either on **Ephemeral Rollups** or **Solana** — based on transaction metadata.

This eliminates the need for manual routing logic from the developer, providing significant benefits in transaction speed and development experience.

- ✅ **Simple Integration with Single Endpoint**: Just connect to a single RPC endpoint.
- ✅ **Seamless Wallet Experience**: Connect, sign, and submit — no need to know what’s happening behind the scenes.
- ✅ **Faster Confirmations**: Magic Router routes to the fastest available endpoint.

## Code Snippets

<MagicRouterSDK />

The Magic Router analyzes each transaction’s metadata (e.g. writable accounts, owner, and signer) and automatically routes it to the closest dedicated endpoint:

1. **Client - Transaction Submission** The dApp or user sends a transaction to the
Magic Router RPC endpoint.

2. **RPC - Metadata Inspection**
   The Magic Router inspects the transaction metadata and checks the owner of writable accounts.

3. **Validator - Smart Routing and Execution**
   Based on the metadata, the router determines whether to send it to:

   - **Ephemeral Rollup** for fast, low-latency, zero-cost execution
   - **Solana** for persistent, high-throughput execution
