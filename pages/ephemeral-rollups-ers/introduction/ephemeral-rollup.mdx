[Magicblock's Ephemeral Rollup](/pages/overview/additional-information/whitepaper) **leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)’s account-based structure and parallel execution** to optimize state management. By structuring the state into **clusters**, users can **lock one or multiple accounts** and temporarily shift state execution to a **dedicated auxiliary layer**— "Ephemeral Rollup (ER)".

## Account Lifecyle for executing transactions in real-time with ER:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delegate Account">
    State accounts must be delegated to an specific ER validator first by
    changing the account owner to the [Delegation
    Program](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/delegation-program)
    `DELeGGvXpWV2fqJUhqcF5ZSYMS4JTLjteaAMARRSaeSh` and specifying parameters
    like ER validator, account lifetime and synchronization frequency.
    <Validators />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Transaction in real-time">
    Delegated state accounts are updated in real-time with transactions on the
    ER directly or via [Magic
    Router](/pages/ephemeral-rollups-ers/introduction/magic-router). The
    **initial transaction on ER clones the delegated account** from base layer
    to the ephemeral rollup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit State">
    The operator commits the ephemeral state to the base layer **periodically or
    on-demand**, including new state and relevant pointers. The account state is
    finalized using a fraud-proof mechanism as detailed in the paper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Transaction in real-time continuously">
    Delegated account states can continuously be updated in real-time on the ER
    directly or via [Magic
    Router](/pages/ephemeral-rollups-ers/introduction/magic-router).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Undelegate Account">
    Delegated account states are committed through ER validator to the base
    layer and the account owner are reversed from the [Delegation
    Program](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/delegation-program)
    `DELeGGvXpWV2fqJUhqcF5ZSYMS4JTLjteaAMARRSaeSh` to the original owner.
  </Step>
