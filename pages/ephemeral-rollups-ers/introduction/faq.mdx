    <Accordion title="Can delegated accounts be created on ER?">
        **No.** Delegated account must exist on Solana beforehand. Delegated accounts are cloned after requesting the account on ER or submitting a transaction with the delegated account.     
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can program accounts be delegated on ER?">
        **No.** Program accounts are never delegated. Only state accounts can be delegated, while **program accounts are cloned** when a transaction is submitted on ER and subscribed for updates thereafter.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can delegated accounts be utilized by all programs on Solana?">
        **Yes.** All programs on Solana can be utilized on ER. Delegated accounts benefit from composability with all Solana programs.

    <Accordion title="Should developers use slot time as a reliable timing mechanism?">
        **No.** As of 2025-11-20, Solana uses a **400 ms slot time**, while MagicBlock’s Execution Runtime (ER) operates with a **50 ms slot time**. Developers may be tempted to rely on slot time as a fixed-duration measure; however, **slot times are not guaranteed and may change over time**. Code or logic that depends on a specific slot duration should therefore be written with caution.
