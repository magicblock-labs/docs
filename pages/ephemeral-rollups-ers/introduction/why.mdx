## Why Ephemeral Rollups?

While blockchain technology is revolutionizing decentralized applications, it still faces fundamental challenges in:

- **Latency** – Blockchain transaction speeds are too slow for real-time applications.
- **Cost** – Even "low-fee" blockchains can become expensive at scale.
- **Scalability** – Current architectures struggle to handle high-throughput applications.
- **Privacy** – Blockchains are by default public, meaning all data onchain can be read.

## **Benefits of MagicBlock's Ephemeral Rollup**

The ephemeral rollup functions as a **specialized SVM runtime** and can be **customized** to include:

- ✅ **Gasless Transactions** – Zero fees enabling scalability and mass adoption.
- ✅ **Faster Block Times** – Sub 10ms latency for seamless UX.
- ✅ **High-precision Scheduling** – Built-in automation to execute transactions.
- ✅ **Program and States Synchronization** – No fragementation, composable and upgradable.
- ✅ **Horizontal Scaling** – Multiple rollups on-demand for millions of transactions.
- ✅ **Familiar Tooling** – Reusability of existing and familiar programming language, libraries and testing tools.
